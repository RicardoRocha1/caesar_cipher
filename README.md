# Caesar Cipher
Fully working Caesar Cipher in Rust.
Takes as input either a string or a .txt file (test with the test_file2.txt already in the repository) and returns a string.

Future improvements:
1. Let user choose shift value -> Only supports a shift of 3 currently.
2. Let user choose output type -> Only supports string currently.
3. Let user choose alphabet -> Only supports latin alphabet currently.
